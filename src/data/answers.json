        "comment": "Many crude oils come out of the well with high levels of H2S, but a stabilisation process usually reduces this level before the crude oil is delivered to the ship. However, the amount of stabilisation may be temporarily reduced at times and a tanker may receive a cargo with an H2S content higher than usual or expected. In addition, some crude oils are never stabilised and always contain high levels of H2S. H2S can also be encountered in refined products such as naphtha, fuel oil, bunker fuels, bitumens and gas oils. Cargo and bunker fuels should not be treated as free of H2S until after they have been loaded and the absence of H2S has been confirmed by both the results of monitoring and the relevant MSDS information. (ISGOTT 2.3.6.1) The use of personal H2S gas monitoring instruments by personnel engaged in cargo operations is strongly recommended. (ISGOTT 2.3.6..4). Notes: Two toxic gas detectors are required on vessels carrying noxious liquids. There should be an adequate supply of chemical indicator tubes (e.g. Draeger tubes), specific to the cargoes being carried and they should be within their expiry date. An up to date inventory of chemical indicator tubes should be maintained. Personnel should be aware that some instrument sensors could be poisoned if exposed to high concentrations of CO2.",
